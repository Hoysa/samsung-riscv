**Setting Up the RISC-V Toolchain.**



The task is to set up the essential tools for the RISC-V Talent Development Program, including installing Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver, 64-bit) on Oracle VirtualBox  and configuring the system with VS C++ Redistributable.

- **Oracle VirtualBox**

Oracle VirtualBox is a free, open-source virtualization software that allows users to run multiple operating systems on a single machine. It supports Windows, Linux, macOS, and other platforms, enabling the creation of virtual machines (VMs) for testing, development, or learning purposes.
