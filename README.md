**Setting Up the RISC-V Toolchain.**



The task is to set up the essential tools for the RISC-V Talent Development Program, including installing Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver, 64-bit) on Oracle VirtualBox  and configuring the system with VS C++ Redistributable.

- **Oracle VirtualBox**

Oracle VirtualBox is a free, open-source virtualization software that allows users to run multiple operating systems on a single machine. It supports Windows, Linux, macOS, and other platforms, enabling the creation of virtual machines (VMs) for testing, development, or learning purposes.

- **Visual studio C++ Redistributable**

The Visual Studio C++ Redistributable is a set of runtime libraries required to run applications developed with Microsoft Visual C++. It provides components like the C Runtime (CRT) and Standard C++ Library, ensuring compatibility and proper execution of C++ programs on Windows, even without Visual Studio installed.

**To write and execute a simple C program to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n**
## **Steps and Process**

### **Step 1: Writing and Compiling Programs**
1. **Program Creation:**
   - Developed programs using a high-level programming language, such as C.
   - Ensured the source code was validated for correctness before proceeding further.

2. **Compilation:**
   - Utilized the RISC-V GCC compiler to convert the high-level code into RISC-V binaries.
   - Explored multiple compiler optimization flags (`-O0`, `-O1`, `-O2`, `-O3`) to observe differences in instruction generation, binary size, and efficiency.

***Key Steps***:
Open a Text Editor: The leafpad text editor is used to create a new file or edit an existing one.

***The command for opening the editor:***
<br>
````leafpad sum1ton.c````
<br>
***The C code for the sum of 1 to n number***
````#include <stdio.h>
int main()
 {
    int i, sum = 0, n = 5;
    for (i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        sum += i;
    }
    printf("Sum of numbers from 1 to %d is %d", n, sum);
    return 0;
}
````
**Compile the C program with GCC:**

````gcc sum1ton.c -o output````

**Run the compiled program:**

````.\a.out````

**STAGE 2**: **Running the programm using RISCV compiler**
***command to compile in RISCV:***
<br>


````riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-O1  -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c````
<br>

***command for assembly code for the above***
<br>

````riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o````
<br>


after that find the main section by writing ````/main````
<br>
and calculate no. of instruction in main section and compare the same by modifying the command .
<br>

***Modified Command***
<br>

````riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-Ofast  -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c````


and then caluculate the no. of instruction.

### **Step 2: Running Programs on Spike Simulator**
1. **Simulator Execution:**
   - The Spike simulator, a RISC-V ISA simulation tool, was employed to run the compiled binaries.
   - Verified the output and functionality of the program during simulation.

2. **Output Observation:**
   - Observed initial outputs during execution to ensure alignment with expected program behavior.

### **Step 3: Debugging Using Spike Simulator**
1. **Initiating Debugging:**
   - Launched the debugging environment using the `spike d` command.
   - Began debugging with a focus on analyzing the programâ€™s instruction-level execution.

2. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - Manually stepped through each instruction while monitoring the state of the program counter (PC).
   - Observed and documented changes in register and memory values for each executed instruction.
   - Validated the output at each stage to ensure the expected behavior was achieved.
